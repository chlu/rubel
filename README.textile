h1. Rubel

Rubel is a Ruby Expression Language.

h2. What is it for?

Rubel is a _safe_ way to execute simple logic like comparisons against a Ruby Hash holding a context.
If you ever wanted to include some functionality e.g. inside views or user defined content, Rubel
will make it easy to evaluate that code. The expression is interpreted and not eval'd in Ruby, so
nothing harmful can be done with the expression.

h2. How does it work?

Rubel evaluates _expressions_ in a given _context_. Expressions are a subset of safe Ruby code. A
context is simply a Hash for now.

h3. Example expression

<pre language="Ruby">
user.firstname == 'Charly' or user.age > 16
</pre>

h3. Evaluating expressions

You can evaluate a Rubel expression like above inside your code:

<pre language="Ruby">
parser = RubelParser.new
result = parser.parse('firstname == 'Charly' or age > 16').
                value({'user' => {'firstname' => 'Charly', 'age' => 15}})
# result => true
</pre>

h2. Supported operations

See tests for now.
